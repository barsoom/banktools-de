# German bank tools

Ruby gem to validate, normalize/prettify and interpret German Bankleitzahl (BLZ) and bank account numbers.

When in doubt, this library aims to err on the side of allowing too much. We've yet to find clear specs, so be aware that the current validation rules are *very* forgiving.

If we got anything wrong, please file an issue or contribute a fix yourself.


## Usage

    # BLZ

    blz = BankTools::DE::BLZ.new("10070024")
    blz.normalize  # => "100 700 24"
    blz.valid?  # => true
    blz.errors  # => []
    blz.bank_name  # => "Deutsche Bank PGK Berlin"

    bad_blz = BankTools::DE::BLZ.new("1X")
    bad_blz.normalize  # => "1X"
    bad_blz.valid?  # => false
    bad_blz.errors  # => [:too_short, :invalid_characters]
    blz.bank_name  # => nil

    # Account

    account = BankTools::DE::Account.new("123456789")
    account.normalize  # => "123 456 789"
    account.valid?  # => true
    account.errors  # => []

    bad_account = BankTools::DE::Account.new("1")
    bad_account.normalize  # => "1"
    bad_account.valid?  # => false
    bad_account.errors  # => [:too_short]


## Tests

    bundle
    rspec  # or: rake


## Update BLZ data

Bundesbank provide a mapping from BLZ to bank name that appears to be updated regularly:

<http://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/DE/Standardartikel/Kerngeschaeftsfelder/Unbarer_Zahlungsverkehr/bankleitzahlen_download.html>

As a gem maintainer, run

    bundle
    rake download URL="http://www.bundesbank.de/â€¦/blz_2013_12_09_xls.xlsx?__blob=publicationFile"

providing a URL for the latest unpacked XLSX version of the data.

You can provide a local path if you want.

This will overwrite the data file in the code repository.

Updates appear to ship for periods of 3 months, provided the month before a period starts. We've seen these periods:
* 2013-09-09 - 2013-12-08
* 2013-12-09 - 2014-03-02


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'banktools-de'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install banktools-de
